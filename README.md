# Next.js from Scratch - Property Pulse Project

Welcome to my repository for the **Next.js from Scratch** course on O'Reilly! In this project, I will be building **Property Pulse**, a full-featured real estate application. This hands-on project will help me learn and master Next.js, a powerful React framework for building server-rendered applications.

## What I Will Build:
- **Property Listings**: I will create a dynamic list of real estate properties showcasing details like price, location, and features.
- **Property Details**: I will build detailed views for each property, including images, descriptions, and contact information.
- **Search and Filtering**: I will implement search and filter functionality to help users find properties that meet their criteria.
- **User Authentication**: I will add secure user authentication for managing property listings and user accounts.
- **Responsive Design**: I will ensure the application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on all devices.

## What I Will Learn:
- **Introduction to Next.js**: I will understand the fundamentals of Next.js and its advantages over other frameworks.
- **Setup and Installation**: I will set up the development environment and create a new Next.js project.
- **Routing and Navigation**: I will implement dynamic routing and navigation within the application.
- **Data Fetching**: I will use Next.js' data fetching methods like `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and `getStaticPaths` to fetch and display data.
- **API Routes**: I will create API routes in Next.js to handle server-side logic and data processing.
- **Styling**: I will apply styles using CSS modules and styled-components for a polished user interface.
- **Authentication**: I will implement authentication and authorization for secure user access.
- **Deployment**: I will deploy the Next.js application to Vercel or other hosting platforms.

## Additional Activities:
- **Deep Dive into Documentation**: Besides the O'Reilly video lectures, I will explore the official Next.js documentation to deepen my understanding.
- **Mini Projects**: I will build smaller projects to practice specific features like dynamic routing and data fetching.
- **Community Engagement**: I will participate in Next.js and React communities, seeking feedback and learning from other developers.
- **Code Reviews**: I will review and refactor my code regularly to ensure best practices and optimize performance.
- **Experimentation**: I will experiment with different Next.js plugins and libraries to extend the functionality of my application.

By the end of this course, I will have a solid foundation in Next.js and a complete project to showcase in my portfolio. This repository will document my journey and serve as a reference for my learning and development process.
